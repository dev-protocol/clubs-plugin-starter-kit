# Clubs Plugin Starter Kit

## Files and directories

## src/

`src` directory manages all source files for this plugin you are developing.

## preview/

`preview` directory has a minimal implementation of Clubs and serves locally to debug this plugin you are developing.

The directory contains some boilerplate files that do not need to be edited, and some files whose values can be rewritten to debug the plugin.

The following files are intended to be rewritten for debugging purposes:

- preview/config.ts
- preview/plugins.ts

The following files are boilerplate and there is no need to rewrite them bacically:

- preview/astro.config.mjs
- preview/tailwind.config.mjs
- preview/src/\*
